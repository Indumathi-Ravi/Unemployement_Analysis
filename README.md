## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze unemployment rates using Python and machine learning techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to understand trends and make future predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be obtained from Kaggle or other open data repositories. It includes information on unemployment rates, labor force participation, and other relevant variables.

## Installation
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You will also need to install the necessary Python libraries.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Unemployment_Analysis.git
cd Unemployment_Analysis

Load the dataset: Place your dataset in the project directory and update the file path in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
Run the analysis: Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script and run the cells to perform data preprocessing, EDA, and modeling.

\  Results
The results of the analysis include visualizations of unemployment trends, correlation heatmaps, and predictive models. These insights can help understand the factors affecting unemployment rates and predict future trends.
